## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.1] - 2025-04-18
### Changed
- Switched license from `EPL 2.0` to `MIT` (issue [#10]).
  The license switch has been authorized through a restructuring review supervised by the « Eclipse Management
  Organization » team https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/emo/-/issues/908#note_3394156.

## [2.2.0] - 2024-09-06
### Added
- Added a new method `boolean isReaderContactless(String readerName)` to the `LocalServiceApi` interface.
  This method enables the Local lib to identify whether or not a reader is contactless, 
  so that it can transmit this information to the Remote lib as soon as possible. 
  This reduces the number of network exchanges.

## [2.1.1] - 2024-04-12
### Changed
- Java source and target levels `1.6` -> `1.8`
### Upgraded
- Gradle `6.8.3` -> `7.6.4`

## [2.1.0] - 2023-11-27
### Added
- Added a new method `int exchangeApiLevel(int coreApiLevel)` to the `LocalServiceSpi` interface to enable Core and
  Distributed layers to exchange their JSON API levels.
- `CHANGELOG.md` file (issue [eclipse-keyple/keyple#6]).
- Added project status badges on `README.md` file.
- CI: Forbid the publication of a version already released (issue [#3]).
### Fixed
- CI: code coverage report when releasing.

## [2.0.0] - 2021-10-06
